SuperLender is a local digital lending company, which prides itself in its effective use of credit risk models to deliver profitable and high-impact loan alternative. Its assessment approach is based on two main risk drivers of loan default prediction: (1) willingness to pay and (2) ability to pay.

## Project Overview
This project was aimed at predicting if a loan was good (1) or bad (0) using the borrower's information as the training set. It helps the SuperLender's loan officer make a calculated decision based on repayment odds, which in turn determines if an applicant should get a loan and, if so, what the size, price, and tenure of the offer will be.
